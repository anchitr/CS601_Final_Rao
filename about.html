                        <h2>My Background</h2>
                        <p>Hi! I'm Anchit Rao, a 2nd year graduate student studying Computer Information Systems at
                            Boston University. I'm
                            passionate about building software that makes a difference in people's lives.
                            My story starts in the metropolitan city of Bangalore, India. I was born and raised in
                            Bangalore for five years
                            before my family moved to the United States. We moved to the sunny state of California,
                            where I still live today. I attended elementary, middle, and high school in California. I
                            graduated from high school
                            in 2013, attended my local community college for three years before transferring to
                            Indiana University in Bloomington to study Accounting. While I was there, I discovered the
                            power of Python
                            programming and took a class, which sparked my interest in programming. I ultimately ended
                            up
                            switching my major to Informatics, and completed my undergraduate studies in 2019.

                        <p>
                            Since then, I've been working as a <i>Software Engineer</i> for HCL Technologies, consulting
                            at Western Digital. I
                            was
                            brought on to work on a project that was meant to replace a legacy system for tracking and
                            managing every serial number of every hard drive that Western Digital manufactures. I was
                            responsible for designing
                            the front-end of the application using Figma. I also worked on modeling and creating the
                            backend database in Oracle SQL Developer. Recently, I've been utilizing Apache Airflow and
                            Python to automate
                            multiple data pipelines
                            for our e-commerce site's search backend.

                        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not working, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and reading books. I'm a
                            huge fan of classic
                            Hollywood cinema, primarily noir and westerns. I've watched every movie I could stream in
                            those genres and have
                            rewatched many of them multiple times. I've recently been introduced to the rabbit hole of
                            Korean dramas through
                            Netflix, and I can't get enough of them. I also enjoy reading books, and I'm currently
                            reading <i>Ultralearning</i>
                            by Scott H. Young. When it comes to video games genres, I typically play MMOFPS like Call of
                            Duty MW3 or
                            stealth-based single player games. I'm currently playing <i>Lethal Company</i> on my PC with
                            friends and we're all
                            having a great time. You should check it out!
